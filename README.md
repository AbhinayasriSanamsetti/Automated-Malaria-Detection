# Automated-Malaria-Detection
The project follows a two-stage pipeline for cell analysis. First, a YOLO-based object detection model is used to detect and localize cells from a whole-slide or microscopy image. Each detected region is then cropped and passed to a Swin Transformer classifier for fine-grained multi-class classification. The training pipeline includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, early stopping, checkpoint-based resume support, and detailed evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. During inference, the system produces labeled bounding boxes on the input image and saves the final annotated output for analysis.
